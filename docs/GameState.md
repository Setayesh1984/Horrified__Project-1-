# üß† Game State - HORRIFIED (Phase 2)

> Last updated: 2025-07-10  
> Author: Backend Team (Setayesh) 
> Status:  Ready for Serialization + UI Sync

---

## üéØ Purpose

This document defines the **full game state structure** that must be serialized (saved/loaded) and kept in sync with the UI.

It serves as the foundation for:
- Save/Load System 
- Backend ‚Üî Frontend Communication 
- Graphical Display (Raylib or UI Framework)

## üîê Serialization Notes

- Use JSON or binary formats
- Enum values should be serialized as strings (e.g., `"Archaeologist"`)
- Pointers (e.g., Location*) should be stored as **unique names** and resolved on load

---

## üîÆ Future Fields (Planned in Phase 2)

- `menuState: enum` ‚Üí Which screen was active on save?
- `selectedHeroes: vector<string>` ‚Üí For replay
- `highlightedPath: vector<string>` ‚Üí For animated moves (in UI)

- [`class_docs.md`](./class_docs.md) ‚Üí Class-level descriptions
- [`ui_requirements.md`](./ui_requirements.md) ‚Üí Required UI ‚Üî Backend interfaces

üìò **Tip:** Any additions to the game logic (new monsters, heroes, or map changes) must be reflected here and kept in sync with the struct used for save/load and UI rendering.
