##  Conventions & Notes

- All pointer fields must be saved using **unique string identifiers** (e.g., `location name`)
- Enum values (HeroType, MonsterType, Phase) should be saved as strings
- Keep this document updated if **new classes, methods, or states** are added during Phase 2
- Consider splitting abstract and derived classes (e.g., `Dracula`, `InvisibleMan`) in future versions
