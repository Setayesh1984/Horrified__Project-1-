# Horrified - OOP Board Game Simulation

This project is a text-based simulation of the cooperative board game *Horrified*, developed as part of an advanced Object-Oriented Programming course.

## 🧩 Game Overview
In Horrified, two players cooperate to defeat classic monsters such as Dracula and the Invisible Man, while protecting innocent villagers across a connected map of locations.

Players control heroes (Archaeologist or Mayor) with unique abilities. They move, collect items, rescue villagers, and execute strategies to defeat monsters. Each monster has a unique logic, behavior, and defeat condition.

## 🎯 Key Features

- Custom logic for Dracula and Invisible Man
- Item and Villager management
- Perk cards with special powers
- Strategic movement between connected locations
